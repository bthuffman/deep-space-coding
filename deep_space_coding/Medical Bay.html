		<h2>Fasting</h2>
		<p>The trick with fasting is to avoid eating long enough (about 12 hours) for the pancreas to stop producing insulin.
			Insulin prevents the use of bodily fat for energy. When fasting the body begins to enter Ketosis during which the primary
			source of energy becomes stored fat. Other benefits accrue as well with the hormones promoting muscle growth, boosts
			to the immune system, decreases in inflamation, faster healing and recovering. In contrast a restricted diet will not
			yeild any of these benefits. By eating regulalry while restricitng your calorie intake you prevent the body from buring
			fat. Another side affect of this kind of dieting is that your hunger will increase making it more difficult to maintain
			and easier to overeat. In contrast, your hunger disappates with time with fasting and many even recommend that once you get
			past the first day or two of ravenous hunger that you will feel no hunger at all. Once this is achieved they recommend
			you don't eat again until your hunger returns some days or weeks later in order to maximize the benefits of the fast.
			Eitehr way fasting is a better choice for your health and if want to see any substantial benefits in muscle growth and
			fat reduction I would recommend doing it for at least 16 hours at a time frequently. </p>
